* Are you age 50+?
* Do you work or live in a congregate setting?
	* Individuals who reside or work in a high risk congregate residential setting, such as an incarceration/detention facility, homeless shelter, or behavioral health facility, as these settings are high risk for outbreaks and have a concentration of individuals with high risk chronic health conditions. This includes all people experiencing homelessness, who are at risk of transitioning into congregate settings at short notice. 
* Are you age 16+, and have a high-risk medical condition?
	* Beginning March 15, healthcare providers may use their clinical judgement to vaccinate individuals age 16-64 who are deemed to be at the very highest risk for morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 as a direct result of one or more of the following severe health conditions, and individuals in specified settings are eligible to be vaccinated due to increased risk, as specified in this provider bulletin:

- Cancer, current with debilitated or immunocompromised state
- Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 or above
- Chronic pulmonary disease,  oxygen dependent

- Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hemoglobin A1c level greater than 7.5%

Healthcare providers may also vaccinate individuals with  developmental or other severe disabilities or illness if:

The individual is likely to develop severe life-threatening illness or death from COVID-19 infection
Acquiring COVID-19 will limit the individual's ability to get ongoing care or services vital to their well-being and survival
Providing adequate and timely COVID care will be particularly challenging as a result of the individual's disability.
These include people with a range of physical and behavioral disabilities, such as:

People with serious mental illness (SMI)
Those with serious substance use disorder (SUD)
All enrolled consumers of:
Regional centers
Independent living centers 
In-home supportive services
Community-based adult services/adult day health centers
Medi-Cal HIV/AIDS waiver

	* The Hard-Hit Community Vaccination Strategy currently applies to the following ZIP codes in Central Falls, Pawtucket, and Providence: 02863, 02860, 02861, 02904, 02905, 02907, 02908, and 02909. (see [here](https://covid.ri.gov/vaccination/rhode-islands-hard-hit-community-vaccination-strategy))
* Are you homebound or otherwise unable to leave your home to get to a vaccination site, even with assistance?
	* RIDOH is partnering with three agencies—Alert Ambulance, MedTech Ambulance, and PACE—to administer COVID-19 vaccines to homebound people in their residences. If you have already completed the survey, one of these agencies will contact you soon to schedule a vaccination appointment. These agencies will begin vaccinating some people as soon as March 20.

Please note that Rhode Island has access to a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines. Appointments for in-home vaccination are therefore being prioritized based on age and geography. Appointments will be made first for the oldest people and those who live in one of the following high-density communities: 02860, 02861, 02863, 02893, 02895,02904, 02905, 02906, 02907, 02908, 02909, 02910, 02911, 02914, 02919, and 02920.

RIDOH encourages those who can safely attend vaccination opportunities outside the home to do so. Due to limited vaccine supply, requests to vaccinate caregivers during a homebound vaccination appointment will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Such requests should only be made in situations where a caregiver leaving the home to seek vaccination will jeopardize the safety or care of the homebound individual. Caregivers who are vaccinated during a homebound vaccination appointment must meet current Rhode Island COVID-19 vaccination eligibility criteria.

If you are unable to leave home to receive COVID-19 vaccination, or are the healthcare provider or family caregiver of someone who is homebound, please inform RIDOH through the following survey:  (see [here](http://bit.ly/homeboundvax))

* Are you a healthcare worker?
* Are you age 60+?
* Are you age 50+ and live in a multigenerational household?
* Are you a long term care resident or work in a long term care facility?
* Are you classified as an essential worker?
	* This includes high-risk critical workers (those who work in an enclosed space around other people and cannot maintain physical distance) in the following industries: 
- agriculture
- fishing vessel crews
- food processing
- grocery store/food bank

- educators and school staff for pre-kindergarten through 12th grade and child care workers
- restaurants
- food services 
- construction
- manufacturing

* Are you a person with a rare condition or disability that put you at higher risk?
	* People with disabilities wondering about their eligibility should apply the definition to their situation: Does their disability put them at increased risk for COVID-19? They can also work with their health care provider to assess their eligibility. In particular, Down syndrome increases risk for severe illness and is on the CDC list. Research continues to emerge on other developmental and intellectual disabilities that put someone at increased risk, so these eligibility guidelines lean toward inclusiveness.

People with disabilities are eligible in 1B tier 2 if:

Their disability alone puts them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g. Down syndrome).
They have a disability that doesn't alone put them at higher risk but they also have another underlying condition from the CDC list. (e.g. A person who is deaf and has Type 2 diabetes). (see [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html))

Eligible Veterans can also call us directly at 206-716-5716 to schedule, or contact their primary care team.
* Are you age 16+, and have two or more high-risk medical conditions?
	* This includes those who have two or more of the following:
