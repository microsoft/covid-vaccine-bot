	* Among Georgia’s current eligible populations for vaccination are individuals aged 16 and older with disabilities and their caregivers, parents of children with complex medical conditions who are at high risk for COVID-19 complications and individuals with certain medical conditions as defined below.

Intellectual Disability is a disability characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical skills. This disability originates before the age of 22.

Developmental disability is a physical or mental impairment that happens before the age of 22, is expected to last a lifetime, and impacts at least three activities of daily living. Activities of daily living include self-care; receptive and expressive language; learning; mobility; self-direction; capacity for independent living; and economic self-sufficiency.

Disabilities also include disabilities caused by an injury (e.g., traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury), a disability due to a longstanding condition that could cause vision loss, nerve damage or loss of a limb, or a disability due to illness such as ALS or multiple sclerosis.

Caregivers provide care to people who need some degree of ongoing assistance with everyday tasks on a regular or daily basis. The recipients of care can live either in residential or institutional settings, range from children to older adults, and have chronic illnesses or disabling conditions. (see [here](https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-vaccine-eligibility))
* Are you a K-12 educator or work in a licensed child care facility?
	* Workers in Pre-K, K-12, DECAL licensed or exempt childcare programs are eligible
* Are you a parent of a child with a complex medical condition?
	* This includes children with one or more of the following conditions considered at high risk for COVID complications: 
Malignancies requiring active treatment
Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) including organ transplant (bone marrow or solid organ) within 2 years
Critical congenital heart disease
Asthma (moderate to severe)
Sickle cell disease
Diabetes
Obesity (BMI >95%)
Cystic fibrosis
Significant neurologic injury or condition (e.g. hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury, congenital anomaly, acute flaccid myelitis) with functional/developmental impairment (e.g. cerebral palsy, developmental disability, prematurity, mitochondrial disease)
Technology dependence (e.g. BiPAP, trach) (see [here](https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-vaccine))
* Are you age 16+, and have a high-risk medical condition?
	* Individuals aged 16 and older with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19. Severe illness from COVID-19 is defined as hospitalization, admission to the ICU, intubation or mechanical ventilation, or death. These conditions include:

Asthma (moderate to severe)

* Are you age 65+?
* Are you age 50+ and live in a multigenerational household?
* Are you a long term care resident or work in a long term care facility?
* Are you classified as an essential worker?
	* This includes high-risk critical workers* in the following industries: agriculture, fishing vessel crews, food processing, grocery store/food bank, corrections (prisons, jails, detention centers), court of law, public transit, and remaining first responders
*Work in an enclosed space around other people and cannot maintain physical distance.

This also includes educators and school staff for pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, and child care workers
* Are you age 16+, and have a high-risk medical condition?
	* People with disabilities wondering about their eligibility should apply the definition to their situation: Does their disability put them at increased risk for COVID-19? They can also work with their health care provider to assess their eligibility. In particular, Down syndrome increases risk for severe illness and is on the CDC list. Research continues to emerge on other developmental and intellectual disabilities that put someone at increased risk, so these eligibility guidelines lean toward inclusiveness.

People with disabilities are eligible in 1B tier 2 if:

Their disability alone puts them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g. Down syndrome).
They have a disability that doesn’t alone put them at higher risk but they also have another underlying condition from the CDC list. (e.g. A person who is deaf and has Type 2 diabetes). (see [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html))
* Are you currently pregnant?
