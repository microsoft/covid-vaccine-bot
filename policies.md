## Hawaii Active Phase (1c)

* Are you a healthcare worker?
* Are you a long-term care resident?
* Are you classified as an essential worker?
	* Frontline essential workers are defined as workers whose duties must be performed on-site, require being in close proximity (less than 6 feet) to the public or coworkers, and are essential to the functioning of society. Some examples of essential workers in 1b include: first responders, critical infrastructure and key resources (i.e. harbor and dock workers, electric, gas, water, sewer, telephone), education (i.e. teachers, staff, early childhood education), public transit workers, those essential for federal, state, and local government operations, food production and agriculture workers, grocery store workers, and U.S. Postal Service. This also includes those employed at hotels, restaurants, and bars
* Are you age 16+, and have a high-risk medical condition?
	* This includes:
- Individuals on dialysis
- Individuals with severe respiratory disease who are on oxygen
- Individuals undergoing chemotherapy or other infusion therapy

People with other chronic conditions also qualify for vaccine in Phase 1c, but not immediately. Data shows a correlation between medical conditions and age, so age will serve as a surrogate for many of these other chronic medical conditions. People with these chronic illnesses will be eligible for vaccine by age in descending order.
* Are you age 60+?

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of many underlying medical conditions on the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, adults of any age with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19:

Asthma (moderate-to-severe)
Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)
Cystic fibrosis
Hypertension or high blood pressure
Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines
Neurologic conditions, such as dementia
Liver disease
Overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2, but < 30 kg/m2)
Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)
Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder)
Type 1 diabetes mellitus

## Michigan Active Phase (1c)

* Are you a healthcare worker? (see [here](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/coronavirus/MI_COVID-19_Vaccination_Prioritization_Guidance_2152021_716344_7.pdf))
* Are you a long term care resident or work in a long term care facility?
	* Group A: Vaccinate workers who have direct contact with large number of vulnerable residents. Note: this would include staff who come in and out of the buildings.
- Skilled nursing facility staff
- Psychiatric hospital staff
- Homes for aged staff
- Adult foster care centers staff
- Assisted living facility staff
- Home health care workers caring for high risk clients with large patient loads (e.g., people with a tracheostomy/ventilator at home)

Group B: Vaccinate vulnerable residents in long-term care facilities.
- Skilled nursing facility residents
- Psychiatric hospitals patients
- Homes for aged residents
- Adult foster care centers residents
- Assisted living facility residents (see [here](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/coronavirus/MI_COVID-19_Vaccination_Prioritization_Guidance_2152021_716344_7.pdf))
* Are you classified as an essential worker?
	* Prioritized frontline workers whose work role has frequent or intense exposure, and, due to the nature of the work, are not able to maintain social distance. For example, a first responder may have to physically touch other people in their response, and a child care provider cannot maintain social distance from children when caring for their physical needs. Per CDC guidance, vaccinating staff and incarcerated/detained persons is recommended because of shared increased risk of disease. The specific prioritized categories are:
- Pre-Kindergarten through high school teachers, support staff and child care workers who usually have direct contact with children
- First responders not covered in Phase 1A (e.g., firefighters, police, conservation officers, inspectors)
- Corrections workers (e.g., staff in prisons, jails, juvenile justice facilities) and incarcerated or detained individuals, due to shared increased risk of disease and the difficulty in controlling outbreaks in correctional facilities
- Workers in homeless shelters, as well as residents, given congregate settings could facilitate the spread of infection.
- Workers in congregate child care institutions*, and adult and child protective services.

Other frontline essential workers in sectors essential to the functioning of society and are at substantially higher risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 because their work-related duties must be performed on site and involve being in close proximity (i.e., within 6 feet) to the public or to coworkers. Frontline essential workers in critical infrastructures included by ACIP are:
- Food and agriculture workers;
- Critical manufacturing workers
- Public transit workers
- Grocery store workers
- U.S. Postal Service workers
- Workers with unique skill sets not covered above, such as non-hospital
laboratories  (see [here](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/coronavirus/MI_COVID-19_Vaccination_Prioritization_Guidance_2152021_716344_7.pdf))
* Are you age 16+, and have a high-risk medical condition?
	*  Individuals age 16 to 64 years living with disabilities*, substance use disorders, severe mental illness, and/or with COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes, obesity or other conditions that puts them at high risk of negative COVID-19 outcome. These include:
Cancer
Chronic kidney disease
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
Down Syndrome
Heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies
Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant
Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 kg/m2 or higher but < 40 kg/m2)
Severe Obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2)
Pregnancy
Sickle cell disease
Smoking
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Asthma (moderate-to-severe)
Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)
Cystic fibrosis
Hypertension or high blood pressure
Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines
Neurologic conditions, such as dementia
Liver disease
Overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2, but < 30 kg/m2)
Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)
Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder)
Type 1 diabetes mellitus

Group C: Caregiver family members and guardians age 16 and over of children with special health care needs, including any physical, developmental, mental, sensory, behavioral, cognitive, or emotional impairment or limiting condition that requires medical management, health care intervention and/or use of specialized services or programs. The condition may be congenital, developmental, or acquired through disease, trauma, or environmental cause and may impose limitations in performing daily self-maintenance activities or substantial limitations in a major life activity. (see [here](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/coronavirus/MI_COVID-19_Vaccination_Prioritization_Guidance_2152021_716344_7.pdf))
* Are you age 50+? (see [here](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/coronavirus/MI_COVID-19_Vaccination_Prioritization_Guidance_2152021_716344_7.pdf))

## Washington Active Phase (1b_tier_2)

* Are you a healthcare worker?
* Are you age 65+?
* Are you age 50+ and live in a multigenerational household?
* Are you a long term care resident or work in a long term care facility?
* Are you classified as an essential worker?
	* This includes high-risk critical workers in the following industries: 
- agriculture
- fishing vessel crews
- food processing
- grocery store/food bank
- corrections (prisons, jails, detention centers)
- courts of law
- public transit
- remaining first responders
- educators and school staff for pre-kindergarten through 12th grade and child care workers
- those who work in an enclosed space around other people and cannot maintain physical distance.
* Are you a person with a rare condition or disability that put you at higher risk?
	* People with disabilities wondering about their eligibility should apply the definition to their situation: Does their disability put them at increased risk for COVID-19? They can also work with their health care provider to assess their eligibility. In particular, Down syndrome increases risk for severe illness and is on the CDC list. Research continues to emerge on other developmental and intellectual disabilities that put someone at increased risk, so these eligibility guidelines lean toward inclusiveness.

People with disabilities are eligible in 1B tier 2 if:

Their disability alone puts them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g. Down syndrome).
They have a disability that doesn't alone put them at higher risk but they also have another underlying condition from the CDC list. (e.g. A person who is deaf and has Type 2 diabetes).
* Are you currently pregnant?
* Are you a veteran?
	* VA Puget Sound is now providing Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccines depending on the site, which include:  Seattle, American Lake, Silverdale, Mount Vernon, and our Mobile Medical Unit. We continue to proactively contact Veterans to make vaccine appointments. Please, no walk-in vaccines, they are by appointment only. Eligible Veterans can also call us directly at 206-716-5716 to schedule, or contact their primary care team.

	* Starting March 1, staff and residents of congregate living facilities became eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Some settings in this group may be non-voluntary or provide services to marginalized populations - meaning residents do not have the resources or choice to mitigate exposure. Congregate living facility staff and residents include the following:
