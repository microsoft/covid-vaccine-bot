c19.eligibility.moreinfo/health.are_you_homebound.ri.1a,"RIDOH is partnering with three agencies—Alert Ambulance, MedTech Ambulance, and PACE—to administer COVID-19 vaccines to homebound people in their residences. If you have already completed the survey, one of these agencies will contact you soon to schedule a vaccination appointment. These agencies will begin vaccinating some people as soon as March 20.

Please note that Rhode Island has access to a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines. Appointments for in-home vaccination are therefore being prioritized based on age and geography. Appointments will be made first for the oldest people and those who live in one of the following high-density communities: 02860, 02861, 02863, 02893, 02895,02904, 02905, 02906, 02907, 02908, 02909, 02910, 02911, 02914, 02919, and 02920.

RIDOH encourages those who can safely attend vaccination opportunities outside the home to do so. Due to limited vaccine supply, requests to vaccinate caregivers during a homebound vaccination appointment will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Such requests should only be made in situations where a caregiver leaving the home to seek vaccination will jeopardize the safety or care of the homebound individual. Caregivers who are vaccinated during a homebound vaccination appointment must meet current Rhode Island COVID-19 vaccination eligibility criteria.

If you are unable to leave home to receive COVID-19 vaccination, or are the healthcare provider or family caregiver of someone who is homebound, please inform RIDOH through the following survey: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
